<h1>Law & Orga notification</h1>
<h2>Password reset finished</h2>
<p>Good news! The process of resetting your password is complete.</p>
<p>You can now login again with your new password!</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> It's possible that you are not able to view some records for some time. The encryption keys for these records were deleted (because of the changed password) and they need to be restored. This will happen automatically if users with the corresponding keys login. Just wait for a bit until they're resolved.</p>
<p>Optionally you can tell the other consultant of the record to login, it should be accessible for you after that.</p>
<p>Sorry for the spam and have a nice day!</p>
