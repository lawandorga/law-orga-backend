## Tech

This project uses Django, which is based on python.

### Local Setup

1. `git clone https://github.com/lawandorga/law-orga-apps.git`
2. `cd law-orga-backend/`
3. `python -m venv tmp/venv`
4. Install all dependencies from `requirements.txt` with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Create `tmp/media/`, `tmp/static/`, `tmp/logs`
6. Run `python manage.py runserver`

### Server Setup

You might want to look into the following file: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. You need to set some environment
variables and with them the workflow file pushes a docker container into a docker registry. From that registry you can
deploy the image to the hoster of your choice. Some environment variables need to be set within the running environment.
